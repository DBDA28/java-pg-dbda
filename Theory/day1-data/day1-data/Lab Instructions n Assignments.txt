Day 1

1. Ensure that you have followed "day1-data\day1_help\Installation instructions for JDK n IDE.txt" & installed JDK 11 on your computer. 
Confirm that you have also downloaded Eclipse IDE (STS 3.9.18)

2. Edit System environment variable "Path"
Must have 1st entry in the Path as : <JDK>/bin
(Already shown in the theory session)

3. Revise class work using 
3.1 Refer to "day1-data\day1_help\sequence.txt
3.2 Refer to code samples from : day1-data\code\day1\src

4. Go through "day1-data\day1_help\slides\PPTDay1.pdf"

5. Go through some of the readymade code samples given for practice.
day1-data\day1_help\rdy_code\Test1.txt, Test2.txt ,Test3.txt, Test4.txt
(Refer to while & switch-case syntax carefully)
 
6. Solve
Mandatory assignment
The java program should run till user enters "quit" or any other option than add or sub or mult or div.
Prompt user to enter the input operation : (add|sub|mult|div) & 2 numbers(double)
Display the result of the operation.
Use Scanner for accepting all inputs from user. 
Hint : use switch-case

Optional Work

7. Accept range of numbers (begin value & end value) from user , using scanner.
Print all prime nos from the range
Try writing the functionality of checking for prime number in a method n call it from main

8.Accept range of numbers (begin value & end value) from user , using scanner.
Print all even nos from the range
Try writing the functionality of checking for even number in a method n call it from main

Accept range of numbers (begin value & end value) from user , using scanner.
Print all prime nos from the range
Try writing the functionality of checking for prime number in a method n call it from main


9. Find the compound interest n the amount 
Accept principle , interest rate n time period in years from user , using scanner.
Formula : 
Compound Interest=Principle*(1+(rate / 100))^time â€“ Principle
time : time period in years.

10. Accept 2 numbers from user n swap them n display.
